# Picture-in-picture selection screenshot

Work in progress !

## Current state

![Alt Text](usage.gif)

## ressources

This allows you to populate PiP with pretty much anything: [document picture-in-picture](https://wicg.github.io/document-picture-in-picture/)  
To get screenshot from a rectangle selection: [html2canvas docs](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/documentation)

## test it for yourself

download the folder  
load the extension with chrome (load unpacked extension)  
click the extension icon  
click the popup button  
draw a rectangle and see result

## explanation

Works in essence but the picture created is actually
not at all what you select, it's missing elements 
that don't display and it's not properly framed so 
still some work...

## TODO:

maybe find better way to take screenshot from selection  
wrong dimension of image  
pip window not well sized for image
